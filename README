--                    Interpreter for Wadler's language CP                    --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This provides a small interpreter for Wadler's language CP (although see last
section for notes on syntax and differences.)

Building
--------

Building the tool requires the compiler tool bnfc[1], a recent version of GHC,
and the readline package.  'make' should build an executable 'cpi' in the
current directory; 'make clean' should remove it.  You may need to update the
Makefile to point to wherever you've installed bnfc, if you haven't gotten it by
'cabal install --user bnfc'

Using
-----

The tool is primarily interactive (although you can, of course, redirect stdin
to avoid retyping long commands).  Commands can be any of the following, where
words in all upper-case are placeholders.

> type NAME = TYPE
> type NAME(VARS) = TYPE

Defines NAME to be an abbreviation for TYPE.  In the second case, if the VARS
are X1,X2,..., then NAME(T1,T2,...) abbreviates TYPE{T1/X1, T2/X2, ...}.
Variables must begin with an uppercase letter.

> def NAME = PROC
> def NAME(VARS) = PROC

Defines NAME to be an appreciation for process expression PROC.  In the second
case, substitution is as for types.  Variables can be either begin with an
uppercase letter, in which case they stand in for entire expressions, or a
lowercase letter, in which case they stand in for a name.

> PROC |- x1:TYPE, x2:TYPE, ...

Checks whether process expression PROC has the behavior given by x1:TYPE, ...,
and, if it does, attempts to find the normal form of PROC.

> :q

Exits the interpreter

An example session:
$ ./cpi
> type Church = forall X.?(X * ~X) || (~X || X)
> def Zero(x) = x(X).x(s).x(z).z<->x
> def Ping(x,y,w) = x[1].x[s].(!s(f).f(a).a().?y[u].u().f[].0 | x[z].(z[].0 | x().w[].0))
> nu x:Church. (Zero(x) | Ping(x,y,w)) |- y:?bot,w:1
w [] . 0
> :q
$

Differences from Wadler's language
----------------------------------

The notation for linear duals and the par combinator is difficult to type.
Instead, the tool uses "~A" to indicate the dual of A, and "P || Q" for P par Q.

The form "x.case()" is not sufficient to determine the structure of a proof, as
the top rule allows arbitrary further linear assumptions to be discharged.
Instead, the form must be written "x.case{x1,x2,...}()", where the x_i are the
names of the additional assumptions to be discharged.
